Warnings:

All APIs marked @Beta at the class or method level are subject to
change. If your code is a library or framework that users outside
your control will include on their classpath, do not use @Beta
APIs (at least without repackaging them somehow).

Serialized forms of ALL objects are subject to change. Do not
persist these and assume they can be read by a future version of
the library.
