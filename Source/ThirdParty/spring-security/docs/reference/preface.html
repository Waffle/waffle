    <p>Spring Security provides a comprehensive security solution for J2EE-based enterprise
      software applications. As you will discover as you venture through this reference guide, we
      have tried to provide you a useful and highly configurable security system.</p>
    <p>Security is an ever-moving target, and it's important to pursue a comprehensive,
      system-wide approach. In security circles we encourage you to adopt "layers of security", so
      that each layer tries to be as secure as possible in its own right, with successive layers
      providing additional security. The "tighter" the security of each layer, the more robust and
      safe your application will be. At the bottom level you'll need to deal with issues such as
      transport security and system identification, in order to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.
      Next you'll generally utilise firewalls, perhaps with VPNs or IP security to ensure only
      authorised systems can attempt to connect. In corporate environments you may deploy a DMZ to
      separate public-facing servers from backend database and application servers. Your operating
      system will also play a critical part, addressing issues such as running processes as
      non-privileged users and maximising file system security. An operating system will usually
      also be configured with its own firewall. Hopefully somewhere along the way you'll be trying
      to prevent denial of service and brute force attacks against the system. An intrusion
      detection system will also be especially useful for monitoring and responding to attacks, with
      such systems able to take protective action such as blocking offending TCP/IP addresses in
      real-time. Moving to the higher layers, your Java Virtual Machine will hopefully be configured
      to minimize the permissions granted to different Java types, and then your application will
      add its own problem domain-specific security configuration. Spring Security makes this latter
      area - application security - much easier. </p>
    <p>Of course, you will need to properly address all security layers mentioned above, together
      with managerial factors that encompass every layer. A non-exhaustive list of such managerial
      factors would include security bulletin monitoring, patching, personnel vetting, audits,
      change control, engineering management systems, data backup, disaster recovery, performance
      benchmarking, load monitoring, centralised logging, incident response procedures etc.</p>
    <p>With Spring Security being focused on helping you with the enterprise application security
      layer, you will find that there are as many different requirements as there are business
      problem domains. A banking application has different needs from an ecommerce application. An
      ecommerce application has different needs from a corporate sales force automation tool. These
      custom requirements make application security interesting, challenging and rewarding. </p>
    <p>Please read <a class="xref" href="getting-started.html" title="Part&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Getting Started">Part&nbsp;I, &#8220;Getting Started&#8221;</a>, in its entirety to begin with. This will
      introduce you to the framework and the namespace-based configuration system with which you can
      get up and running quite quickly. To get more of an understanding of how Spring Security
      works, and some of the classes you might need to use, you should then read <a class="xref" href="overall-architecture.html" title="Part&nbsp;II.&nbsp;Architecture and Implementation">Part&nbsp;II, &#8220;Architecture and Implementation&#8221;</a>. The remaining parts of this guide are structured in a more
      traditional reference style, designed to be read on an as-required basis. We'd also recommend
      that you read up as much as possible on application security issues in general. Spring
      Security is not a panacea which will solve all security issues. It is important that the
      application is designed with security in mind from the start. Attempting to retrofit it is not
      a good idea. In particular, if you are building a web application, you should be aware of the
      many potential vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting, request-forgery and
      session-hijacking which you should be taking into account from the start. The OWASP web site
      (http://www.owasp.org/) maintains a top ten list of web application vulnerabilities as well as
      a lot of useful reference information. </p>
    <p>We hope that you find this reference guide useful, and we welcome your feedback and <a class="ulink" href="#jira" target="_top">suggestions</a>. </p>
