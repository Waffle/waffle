/**
 * Custom authentication strategy for the negotiate logic required for SSO/Negotiate auth realm
 * {@link NegotiateAuthenticationRealm}. When the negotiate logic is executing, one of more round trips with the client
 * occur. When the {@link NegotiateAuthenticationRealm} determines another handshake is needed, it throws the exception:
 * {@link AuthenticationInProgressException}. This custom strategy detects this exception, and immediately re-throws it
 * so classes higher up in the call stack will allow the handshake to proceed. Without this added logic, the handshake
 * could be halted after the first connection by the existing error handling. <br>
 * <br>
 * This strategy is needed when using {@link NegotiateAuthenticationFilter} and more than one realm is configured in
 * shiro.ini. If only one realm is defined, the current error handling in
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.pam.ModularRealmAuthenticator#doSingleRealmAuthentication(org.apache.shiro.realm.Realm, org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationToken)}
 * works fine without requiring this strategy. However, the current error handling in
 * {@link org.apache.shiro.authc.pam.ModularRealmAuthenticator#doMultiRealmAuthentication(java.util.Collection, org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationToken)}
 * does require the {@link NegotiateAuthenticationStrategy} to ensure negotiate 'continue' calls will proceed. So for
 * now, the most reliable approach is to use this strategy.
