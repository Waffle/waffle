WAFFLE is a native Windows Authentication Framework consisting of two C# and Java libraries that perform functions related to Windows authentication, supporting Negotiate, NTLM and Kerberos. Waffle also includes libraries that enable drop-in Windows Single Sign On for popular Java web servers, when running on Windows. While Waffle makes it ridiculously easy to do Windows Authentication in Java, on Windows, Waffle does not work on *nix(UNIX-like).

Unlike many other implementations Waffle on Windows does not require any server-side Kerberos keytab setup, it's a drop-in solution. You can see it in action in [this slightly blurry video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmTwbOh0hBU) produced for [TeamShatter.com](http://www.teamshatter.com/topics/general/team-shatter-exclusive/securing-java-applications-with-smart-cards-and-single-sign-on/).

Documentation
-------------

There're several semi-independent parts to Waffle. Choose the appropriate HowTo.

* Simple native interfaces in C# and Java to do all things Windows authentication. Useful if you're building a custom client that requires Windows authentication. See [Getting Started with WAFFLE API](https://github.com/Waffle/waffle/blob/master/Docs/GettingStartedWithWaffleAPI.md)
* A generic Servlet Negotiate (NTLM and Kerberos) Security Filter that can be used with many web servers, including Tomcat, Jetty and WebSphere. See [HowTo](https://github.com/Waffle/waffle/blob/master/Docs/ServletSingleSignOnSecurityFilter.md).
* A Tomcat Negotiate (NTLM and Kerberos) Authenticator Valve, built for the Tomcat Web Container. See [HowTo](https://github.com/Waffle/waffle/blob/master/Docs/tomcat/TomcatSingleSignOnValve.md).
* A Tomcat Single Sign-On + Form Authentication Mixed Valve, built for the Tomcat Web Container and allowing users to choose whether to do form authentication (a username and password sent to the server from a form) or Windows SSO (NTLM or Kerberos). See [HowTo](https://github.com/Waffle/waffle/blob/master/Docs/tomcat/TomcatMixedSingleSignOnAndFormAuthenticatorValve.md).
* A Spring-Security Negotiate (NTLM and Kerberos) Filter. See [HowTo](https://github.com/Waffle/waffle/blob/master/Docs/spring/SpringSecuritySingleSignOnFilter.md).
* A Spring-Security Windows Authentication Manager. See [HowTo](https://github.com/Waffle/waffle/blob/master/Docs/spring/SpringSecurityAuthenticationProvider.md).
* A JAAS Login Module, useful when extending a custom Java client that already implements JAAS to support Windows SSO. See [HowTo](https://github.com/Waffle/waffle/blob/master/Docs/tomcat/TomcatWindowsLoginJAASAuthenticator.md).
* A WildFly Security Domain implementation, offering support for local Windows and Active Directory users authentication when deploying web apps on WildFly servers. See [HowTo](https://github.com/Waffle/waffle/blob/master/Docs/wildfly/WildFlySecurityDomain.md).

Waffle was created and is sponsored by [Application Security Inc.](https://www.trustwave.com/Company/AppSecInc-is-now-Trustwave/). For a long story, read the [Project History](https://github.com/Waffle/waffle/blob/master/HISTORY.md). Also, feel free to use [this PowerPoint presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/dblockdotorg/waffle-at-nycjavasig) from NYJavaSIG to talk about Waffle.

Features
--------

* Account lookup locally and in Active Directory via Win32 API with zero configuration.
* Enumerating Active Directory domains and domain information.
* Returns computer domain / workgroup join information.
* Supports logon for local and domain users returning consistent fully qualified names, identity (SIDs), local and domain groups, including nested.
* Supports all functions required for implementing server-side single-signon with Negotiate and NTLM and various implementations for Java web servers.
* Supports Windows Identity impersonation.
* Includes a Windows Installer Merge Module for distribution of C# binaries.

How do I resolve JNA `NoClassDefFound` errors?
----------------------------------------------
WAFFLE uses the latest version of JNA, which may conflict with other dependencies your project (or its parent) includes. If you experience issues with `NoClassDefFound` errors for JNA artifacts, consider one or more of the following steps to resolve the conflict:
* Listing WAFFLE earlier (or first) in your dependency list 
* Specifying the most recent version of JNA as a dependency
* If you are using a parent (e.g., Spring Boot) that includes JNA as a dependency, override the `jna.version` property

Demos
-----
WAFFLE packages serveral demos.  When building from the source, you can use ```mvn cargo:run``` to bring any of the demos up.  See further README documentation in each demo (and what doesn't quite work).  Additionally demos are documented in various states in documentation.  This area does need some user help so feel free to contribute.
