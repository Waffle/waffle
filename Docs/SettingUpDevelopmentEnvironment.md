Setting Up a Development Environment
====================================

You're encouraged to contribute to WAFFLE. The latest information about this project and source code can be found on Github at [https://github.com/dblock/waffle](https://github.com/dblock/waffle)

Contributing
------------

Fork the project. Make pull requests. Bonus points for topic branches.

If you're not familiar with this workflow, please read [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). 

Development Environment
-----------------------

### Git

Download Git from [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads). During the installation, the wizard will offer to adjust your `PATH` environment. Select the second option "Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt".

### Java

Download and install the JDK from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Set `JAVA_HOME` to the location of the JDK in your computer's environment settings.

### Ant

Download Ant from [here](https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi) and unzip it to a directory of your choosing, eg. `c:\ant`. Add the `bin` directory to `PATH`, eg. `c:\ant\bin`. You should be able to type `ant` on the command prompt.

### Windows SDK or Microsoft Visual Studio 2008

Visual Studio is not required, but useful when editing .NET code. At the least, install the Windows SDK from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279). You should be able to run `msbuild` from the command prompt.

### NUnit

Download NUnit from [here](http://nunit.org).

### MSBuild Community Tasks

Download and install MSBuild Community Tasks from [here](https://code.google.com/p/msbuildtasks/downloads/list).

### Wix Toolset 3.5

Download and install the Wix toolset, specifically version 3.5 from [here](https://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/60102).

### Eclipse

Eclipse is not required, but useful when editing Java code.

Building the Project the First Time
-----------------------------------

If you are running on Windows Vista or later, you'll want to run the command prompt as Administrator. Type `build all`.

```
c:\source\Waffle\master> build all
```

This downloads thirdparty libraries using Ivy, builds both Debug and Release .NET binaries, all Java code, runs tests and packages a release .zip in the `target` directory.

Using Visual Studio
-------------------

The C# implementation is in a Visual Studio solution file, `Waffle.sln`. 

Using Eclipse
-------------

For Java, use Eclipse and import the projects under `Source`. Make sure to also import the `Thirdparty` project.

To run the demos within the IDE, you can right click *StartEmbeddedJetty* > *Run As* (or *Debug As*) > *Java Appliction*. The server will start on localhost:8080.

To change which demo you are running, edit the code:

```
String path = "../demo/waffle-filter";
```

Trobleshooting
--------------

### Git

```
'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```

Git is missing.

### MSBuild Community Tasks

```
E:\Waffle.proj(2,11): error MSB4019: The imported project "C:\Program Files\MSBuild\MSBuildCommunityTasks\MSBuild.Community.Tasks.Targets" was not found. Confirm that the path in the <Import> declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk.
```

MSBuild Community Tasks are missing.

### Wix

```
"E:\waffle\Waffle.proj" (all target) (1) ->
"E:\waffle\Waffle.sln" (Clean target) (2) ->
(Clean target) ->  E:\waffle\Source\WindowsAuthProviderMergeModule\WindowsAuthProviderMergeModule.wixproj(107,11): error MSB4019: The imported project "C:\Program Files\MSBuild\Microsoft\WiX\v3.x\Wix.targets" was not found. Confirm that the path in the <Import> declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk.
```

Wix is missing.

### Product Version

```
BUILD FAILED
E:\waffle\Source\JNA\build.xml:16: The following error occurred while executing this line:
E:\waffle\Source\JNA\build.xml:4: The following error occurred while executing this line:
E:\waffle\Source\JNA\waffle-jna\build.xml:5: The following error occurred while executing this line:
E:\waffle\Source\JNA\build\build.xml:6: Missing product.version
```

A product version is generated via MSBuild and is applied to the rest of the project. The Java components built with `ant` therefore require that you run `build all` first.

### Unit Tests Failed

```
BUILD FAILED
E:\Source\JNA\build.xml:16: The following error occurred while executing this line:
E:\Source\JNA\build.xml:5: The following error occurred while executing this line:
E:\Source\JNA\build\build.xml:232: The following error occurred while executing this line:
E:\Source\JNA\build\build.xml:127: Unit Tests failed
```

The java components will only generate output if all tests pass. They do when running on Windows 7 as Administrator. If you have a different system, you may skip tests with `ant -DskipTests=true`. Output JARs will be placed in `Source\JNA\bin`.

### Missing Dependencies in Eclipse 

Many thirdparty dependencies in Waffle are downloaded using Ivy when you use `build all` or `ant` under `Source\JNA`. Eclipse will not automatically refresh these dependencies. Click on the project named `thirdparty` and hit F5.
