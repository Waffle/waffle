Does Waffle work on Linux?
==========================

Waffle relies on the [Windows SSPI](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380493.aspx), 
which doesn't exist on *nix. 

For products that work cross-platform, see the [Waffle README](../../README.md) under *Related and Similar Products*.
