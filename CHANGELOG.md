==================

This release unifies support for various Java platforms within a single package and significantly improves development infrastructure.

Features
--------

* Waffle now requires Java 1.6 or newer, uses generics where possible - [@hazendaz](https://github.com/hazendaz).
* Waffle now requires JNA 3.4.2 (currently private build) - [@dblock](https://github.com/dblock).
* Native Tomcat and Spring support has been split out of the `waffle-jna.jar` - [@dblock](https://github.com/dblock).
  * `waffle-spring-security2.jar`: Spring-security 2.

* Rewritten documentation in Markdown, the CHM documentation has been removed - [@dblock](https://github.com/dblock).
* [#3](https://github.com/dblock/waffle/pull/3): Replaced `commons-logging` with `slf4j` and `logback` - [@hazendaz](https://github.com/hazendaz).
  * Use jcl over slf4j for Spring, as it uses `commons-logging`.
* Jacob-based COM interfaces and implementation have been removed - [@dblock](https://github.com/dblock).
* [#1](https://github.com/dblock/waffle/pull/1): Adjusted logging from info to debug to reduce noise level - [@mcfly83](https://github.com/mcfly83).

* [#23] Added `waffle.util.WaffleInfo` which collects system information useful for debugging - [@ryantxu](https://github.com/ryantxu).
* [#28] Added `waffle-jetty` project.  This lets developers run Waffle directly within the IDE - [@ryantxu](https://github.com/ryantxu).
