=========================================

![waffle](https://github.com/dblock/waffle/raw/master/waffle.jpg)

WAFFLE - Windows Authentication Functional Framework (Light Edition) is a native C# and Java library that does everything Windows authentication (Negotiate, NTLM and Kerberos).

Short Story
-----------

Most people will be interested in one of the following.

* Simple native interfaces in C# and Java to do all things Windows authentication.
* A generic Servlet Negotiate (NTLM and Kerberos) Security Filter - [Tutorial](http://code.dblock.org/ShowPost.aspx?id=106).
* A Tomcat Negotiate (NTLM and Kerberos) Authenticator Valve - [Tutorial](http://code.dblock.org/ShowPost.aspx?id=103).
* A Tomcat Single Sign-On + Form Authentication Mixed Valve - [Tutorial](http://code.dblock.org/ShowPost.aspx?id=107).
* A Spring-Security Negotiate (NTLM and Kerberos) Filter - [Totorial](http://code.dblock.org/ShowPost.aspx?id=114).
* A Spring-Security Windows Authentication Manager
* A JAAS Login Module - [Tutorial](http://code.dblock.org/ShowPost.aspx?id=105).
* If you're using Tomcat, Jetty or Websphere with an IIS front-end to do authentication only, Waffle will allow you to get rid of IIS.

Unlike many other implementations WAFFLE on Windows does not usually require any server-side Kerberos keytab setup, it's a drop-in solution. You can see it in action in [this slightly blurry video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmTwbOh0hBU) produced for [TeamShatter.com](http://www.teamshatter.com/topics/general/team-shatter-exclusive/securing-java-applications-with-smart-cards-and-single-sign-on/). 

Waffle was created and is sponsored by [Application Security Inc.](http://www.appsecinc.com/) For a long story, read the [Project History](https://github.com/dblock/waffle/blob/master/HISTORY.md).

Features
--------

* Account lookup locally and in Active Directory via Win32 API with zero configuration.
* Enumerating Active Directory domains and domain information.
* Returns computer domain / workgroup join information.
* Supports logon for local and domain users returning consistent fully qualified names, identity (SIDs), local and domain groups, including nested.
* Supports all functions required for implementing server-side single-signon with Negotiate and NTLM and various implementations for Java web servers.
* Supports Windows Identity impersonation.
* Includes a Windows Installer Merge Module for distribution of C# binaries.

Branches
--------

Waffle includes a servlet filter that works with any servlet container, including Tomcat, Jetty and Websphere. It also contains a native package for Tomcat 6 and Spring Security 3. There're branches for [Tomcat 5](https://github.com/dblock/waffle/tree/tomcat5), [Tomcat 7](https://github.com/dblock/waffle/tree/tomcat7) as well as [Spring Security 2](https://github.com/dblock/waffle/tree/spring-security-2) support.
